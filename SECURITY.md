# Security Policy

We take the security of Log Analyser seriously and appreciate responsible reports of vulnerabilities.

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are applied to the latest commit on `main`. Releases and tags will be patched as needed. If you are using an older version, please upgrade before requesting support.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

- **Do not** open a public GitHub issue for security problems.
- Instead, use one of the following private channels:
  - Open a [GitHub Security Advisory](https://docs.github.com/code-security/security-advisories/reported-vulnerabilities) for this repository.
  - Contact the maintainer via the email address listed on the GitHub profile (or any other private channel previously agreed upon).
- Include as much detail as possible: description, reproduction steps, affected commit/tag, logs, and potential impact.
- We aim to acknowledge new reports within **3 business days** and provide a status update at least once every **7 business days** until the issue is resolved.

## Disclosure Process

1. We confirm the vulnerability and identify affected versions.
2. A fix is implemented, tested, and reviewed.
3. A release or patch is prepared. When applicable, we coordinate the disclosure date with the reporter.
4. We publish the fix along with acknowledgements (unless you request anonymity).

## Scope

This policy covers the Go source code, configuration files, and documentation contained in this repository. Dependencies are handled separately; if you find an issue in an upstream project, please report it to that project's maintainers.

Thank you for helping keep the community safe!
