## Self-Service Resources

- Read the [README](README.md) for setup instructions and examples.
- Review the [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for development tips.
- Check existing GitHub Issues to see whether your question has already been answered.

## Asking Questions

1. Search open and closed issues first.
2. If nothing matches, open a new issue and use a descriptive title.
3. Include:
   - Go version (`go version`)
   - Operating system
   - Steps to reproduce your problem
   - Relevant configuration (e.g., `.env` values)
   - Logs or error messages (redact sensitive data)

## Filing Bugs

Follow the process above, then label the issue with `bug` if you have permissions or mention it in the description. Add sample log lines or attach anonymized files when possible so maintainers can reproduce the issue quickly.

## Feature Requests

- Explain the use case and why the feature is needed.
- Share any alternative approaches you tried.
- If you plan to implement the feature yourself, mention it so we can coordinate design and review.

## Security Issues

Security questions should **not** be filed publicly. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for private reporting instructions.

## Commercial Support

This is a community project and does not include paid support. If you require custom features or SLAs, consider reaching out via GitHub to discuss sponsorship opportunities.
